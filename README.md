# Learning Domain-Driven Design

Thank you for reading the 🐒 book!

The "listings" folder contains all the code samples used in the book. The naming format is the number of a chapter followed by the ordinal number of the code sample in the chapter.

One more thing: keep an eye on this repository, as at this moment I'm working on an open-source implementation of a subset of the Wolfdesk ticketing system described in the book's Preface.
